Sales Rep: Good morning, is this [Stay-at-Home Parent]? 

Stay-at-Home Parent: Yes, this is [Stay-at-Home Parent]. 

Sales Rep: Hi [Stay-at-Home Parent], my name is [Sales Rep], and I'm calling on behalf of [Hospitality Company]. We are a hospitality company that specializes in providing product demonstrations to customers. I'm sure you can relate how important it is to have an expert on hand to show customers our products and services. 

Stay-at-Home Parent: Yes, I can definitely relate. 

Sales Rep: We're looking for someone to join our team and provide product demonstrations to customers. I'm wondering if you would be interested in being part of our team? 

Stay-at-Home Parent: That sounds interesting. What would I be expected to do? 

Sales Rep: Your primary responsibility would be to provide product demonstrations to customers, as well as answer any questions they may have. Additionally, you may have other responsibilities depending on the customer's needs. You may be asked to help with setting up or tearing down equipment, or even helping customers with their orders. 

Stay-at-Home Parent: That sounds like it could be a lot of work. 

Sales Rep: It can be, but we provide comprehensive training and support to ensure that all of our employees are comfortable and confident with the products they are demonstrating. We also offer competitive compensation packages and benefits. 

Stay-at-Home Parent: That sounds great. What is the next step? 

Sales Rep: The next step would be to schedule an interview to discuss the position in more detail. Would you be available for an interview next week? 

Stay-at-Home Parent: Yes, that sounds great. 

Sales Rep: Wonderful! I look forward to speaking with you further. Have a great day!
