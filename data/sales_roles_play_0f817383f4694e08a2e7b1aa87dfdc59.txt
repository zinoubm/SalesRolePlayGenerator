Sales Rep: Hi, I'm [Name] from [Technology Company], and I'm calling to introduce our latest product. Can I please speak with the person in charge of assisting customers with product returns?

College Student: Sure, that would be me. How can I help you?

Sales Rep: Great! I wanted to tell you about our new product that's perfect for college students. It's a laptop that has a long-lasting battery life, a wide selection of ports, and a sleek design. Plus, it comes with a two-year warranty and a 30-day return policy.
