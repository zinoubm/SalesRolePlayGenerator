Sales Rep: Good morning, this is [Sales Rep name] from [Energy Company]. I was wondering if I could speak with the person in charge of answering customer questions about pricing?

Single Parent: Yes, that's me. How can I help you?

Sales Rep: I'm calling to let you know about an amazing new energy plan we're offering that could help you save money.

Single Parent: That sounds interesting. What kind of plan is it?

Sales Rep: It's a fixed-rate plan that gives you the same rate for the duration of your agreement with us. That way, you can budget for your energy costs and have the stability of knowing your rate won't change. 

Single Parent: That does sound appealing. What's the price? 

Sales Rep: Our plans start from just [insert price], so it's very affordable. Plus, we provide discounts for single parents, so you'd get an even better rate.

Single Parent: That sounds great. I'm interested, but I'm also concerned about the quality of service I'll receive if I sign up with your company. 

Sales Rep: We understand your concern, and we take great pride in offering excellent customer service. We have a team of experienced professionals who are available to answer any questions you might have, and we offer 24/7 technical support if you ever need it. 

Single Parent: That's reassuring. How long is the agreement? 

Sales Rep: It's a 12-month agreement, but you can cancel at any time with no penalty. 

Single Parent: That sounds good. I think I'm ready to sign up. 

Sales Rep: Great! I'm so glad to hear that. I'll just need to ask a few more questions to get you set up.
