Entrepreneur: Yes, this is me. What can I do for you?

Sales Rep: We specialize in making sure that our customers are covered in the event of any unexpected issues. Our warranties are designed to give you peace of mind and ensure that your product is always working when you need it.

Entrepreneur: That sounds great. What kind of coverage do your warranties offer?

Sales Rep: We offer a wide range of coverage options including repairs, replacements, and refunds. We also have a 24/7 customer support line so that you can get help anytime you need it.

Entrepreneur: That's really helpful. What happens if I'm not satisfied with the product?
